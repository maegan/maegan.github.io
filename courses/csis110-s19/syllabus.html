              <p>Do not miss an exam; make-up exams will <strong>not</strong> be given unless there is a valid advance reason for missing an exam, i.e. scheduled sports event (intramural events do not count), class trip, etc.  Arrangements must be made <strong>in advance</strong> by contacting your instructor at least two weeks before the scheduled exam date to arrange an alternative time.</p>
              <p class="emphasis">NOTE:  The final exam will be during exam week.  We don’t control when it is, so you should not make any plans that would cause you to miss any portion of exam week until you know when all your exams are.  We will <strong>not</strong> offer alternative exam times for the final exam in this situation.</p>

              <p>In our Franciscan community, diversity is an invitation to celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, as well as the cultural differences that enrich us all. In this course, I will do my best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives will be served equitably. The diversity that students bring to this class will be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful and inclusive of the many identities of students in terms of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics.</p>
              <p>Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity and inclusiveness in this course are encouraged and appreciated.</p>

If you use your phone for talking, texting, or other purposes while you are in class you will be marked absent for that class and lose class participation points. If you use your phone to talk or text during lab, you lose five points off the grade of that lab.  Leaving class to use your phone is not acceptable unless you work for an emergency service (firefighter, EMT, police, etc.).</p>

              <p>A table and iPad with a Google Form will be available in lecture and lab to store your phones during class.  You are not obligated to use this system, but for every 7 times you have relinquished your phone during class, you will receive 1 point added to your final exam score.</p>

              <p>Guidelines are provided (at the website linked below) regarding what is and what is not appropriate collaboration on labs and homework. Academic dishonesty includes such things as violating these guidelines and cheating on an exam.</p>

              <p>The College may be forced to close in certain extraordinary circumstances, such as war, famine, pestilence, massive earthquake, volcanic eruption, or the pandemic outbreak of any number of devastating diseases, including but not limited to smallpox, malaria, leprosy, swamp fever, flu, bubonic plague, sleeping sickness, anthrax, rabies, hemorrhagic fever, pica, and hangnails.</p>

              <p>You are instructed to bring all texts and a copy of the syllabus/course schedule home with you in the event of a College Closure. The Academic Calendar will be adjusted upon Reopening; so be prepared for the possibility of a short mini-semester; rescheduled class/exam period; and /or rescheduling of the semester, depending on the length of the closure.</p>

              <p>You should continue with readings and assignments to the best of your ability, per the course schedule.</p>

              <p>Online office hours will be used by me in order to maintain contact with my students. You will be able to “check-in” with questions that you have. If you do not have internet access available, I will also provide my home phone number and home address, as needed. Remember, internet, mail delivery, and telephone services may also be impacted by a Pandemic or other emergency event.</p>

              <p>Finally, stay connected with information regarding the status of the College’s status and Reopening schedule by monitoring the Siena website, <a href="http://www.siena.edu">www.siena.edu.</a></p>
