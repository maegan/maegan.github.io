    <h1>JavaJam Case Study</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>You want to help a friend develop a web presence for their
      shop that will display the services and provide a calendar for the performances. They would like a home page, menu
      page, music performance schedule page, and a job opportunities page.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1</h2>

    <p> The JavaJams project has some of the pages written, but you'll notice they aren't very exciting and look
      unprofessional. Throughout this case study we will make changes to make it look better. </p>
    <p>Let's start:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an external style sheet named <code>javajam.css</code> that configures the color and text for the
        JavaJam website. </li>
      <li>Since we are going to be using CSS, remove any references to style found in the starting
        <code>index.html</code> (i.e. strong, em, small)
      </li>
      <li>Using the image below and color values, modify the Home page to look like the image. <mark>Make sure you real
          all information in Part 1 before starting.</mark>
        <div class="example">

          <div class="colorList">
            <div class="colorBox" id="text"></div>#221811
            <div class="colorBox" id="bg"></div>#FCEBB6
            <div class="colorBox" id="header"></div>#D2B48C
            <div class="colorBox" id="hs"></div>#8C3826
            <div class="colorBox" id="container"></div>#FEFAEB
          </div>
          <img src="images/firstScreen.jpg" alt="image of home page">
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>Some things you may not notice and/or information you may need:
        <ul>
          <li><code>header</code> and <code>nav</code> bar are centered</li>
          <li><code>nav</code> items are bold</li>
          <li><code>h1</code> element is 200% line height</li>
          <li><code>footer</code> has small font size, italics, and centered text.</li>
          <li>A <code>div</code> with an <code>id</code> of <code>wrapper</code> needs to be created to contain all the
            contents in the body section.</li>
          <li>This wrapper contains the contents of the page.
            The wrapper is centered on the overall page. Be sure to open it in a browser to ensure that it does indeed
            center overall.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once your <code>index.html</code> page looks like the example, make the necessary changes to
        <code>menu.html</code> so that it has the same appearance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    For this part we are going to work towards making changes to the home page so it looks like this image:
    <mark>Again, make sure you read through the steps first.</mark>
    <div class="example">
      <img src="images/part2.jpg" width="350" alt="screenshot from part 2" class="noList">
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>Modify <code>index.html</code> to use this wireframe. To do this, you will have to add some <code>div</code>
        tags with class names and/or ids.
        <div class="box" id="wrapperBox">wrapper
          <div class="box">header</div>
          <div class="box">nav</div>
          <div class="box">div with large image</div>
          <div class="box">main
            <div class="box"> div with contact info<br></div>
          </div>
          <div class="box">footer</div>
        </div>

      </li>
      <li>Replace the "Relax at JavaJam" text contained within the <code>h2</code> element with "Follow the Winding Road
        to JavaJam"</li>
      <li>Add a paragraph with the following text below the <code>h2</code> element and above the existing paragraph:
        <blockquote>We're a little out of the way, but take a drive in the country down
          Garrett Bay Road to JavaJam today! Indulge in our locally roasted free-trade coffee and home-made pastries.
          You'll feel right at home at JavaJam!</blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>Configure the text "JavaJam Coffee Bar Features:" within an <code>h3</code> element below the second paragraph
        and above the unordered list.</li>
      <li>Modify the CSS to display the winding road image as the background image. It should not repeat, it should fill
        the whole window, it should be fixed and the background size should be cover. </li>
      <li>Add a new selector for an <code>id</code> named <code>homehero</code> to configure 300px height and to display
        the <code>hero.jpg</code> background image to fill the space without repeating.</li>
      <li>Modify the CSS so that the <code>wrapper</code> id has a minimum width of 900px and maximum width of 1280px.
        It should also add a drop-shadow effect on the wrapper.</li>
      <li>Add CSS to set top and bottom padding of <code>header</code> to 5px.</li>
      <li>Modify the CSS so the <code>h1</code> element uses a font size of 3em.</li>
      <li>Modify the <code>nav</code> CSS to use a font size of 1.5em, 5px of top padding, and 5px of bottom padding.
      </li>
      <li>Add CSS to prevent the hyperlinks in the <code>nav</code> area from displaying the default underline.</li>
      <li>Modify the CSS so that the <code>footer</code> has 1em of padding and a 2px top border using the same color as
        the headings.</li>
      <li>Add CSS so that the <code>main</code> element has 2em of padding on the left, right, and bottom.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    Once you have completed Part 2, we will update the menu page (<code>menu.html</code>).
    <ol>
      <li>Add an image element for the <code>mugs.jpg</code> image above the <code>h2</code> element in the main content
        area. Be sure to include the alt and height attributes. Also configure the image to appear to the right of the
        text content.</li>
      <li>Add a paragraph with the following text below the <code>h2</code> element:
        <blockquote>Indulge in our locally roasted free-trade coffee and enjoy the aroma, the smooth taste, the
          caffeine! Join our Mug Club and get a 10% discount on each cup of coffee you purchase -- ask the barista for
          details.</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Make any other necessary changes until the page matches this image:
        <div class="example">
          <img class="list" src="images/part3.jpg" width="350" alt="screenshot from part 3">
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 4</h2>
    Now we will create the music page. The final result should look like this image:
    <div class="example">
      <img src="images/part4.jpg" width="350" alt="screenshot from part 4" class="noList">
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li>Copy the <code>menu.html</code> file and rename it <code>music.html</code>.</li>
      <li>Change the page title to an appropriate phrase.</li>
      <li>Delete the image and description list from the page.</li>
      <li>Replace the text in the <code>h2</code> to be "Music at JavaJam"</li>


      <li>Add a paragraph with the following text below the <code>h2</code> element:
        <blockquote>The first Friday night each month at JavaJam is a special night. Join us from 8pm to 11pm for some
          music you won't want to miss!</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>The remaining content of the page will consist of two areas describing music performances. The area describing
        each music performance consists of an <code>h4</code> element, a <code>div</code> of the class
        <code>details</code>, and an image link.
      </li>

      <li>The <code>h4</code> elements should be "January" and "February"</li>
      <li>After each of the <code>h4</code> elements should be a <code>div</code> of class <code>details</code>
        containing both the image and the text.</li>
      <li>Each image is a thumbnail that links to the full size image.</li>
      <li>The text for the two sections are:
        <ul>
          <li>Melanie Morris entertains with her melodic fold style.</li>
          <li>Tahoe Greg is back from his tour. New songs. New stories.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Continue adding styling to CSS until your page looks like the image above.</li>
    </ol>
