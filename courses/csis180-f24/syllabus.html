              <p>An average grade is typically B- to B. To earn a grade of B+ or higher requires consistently scoring
                above 85% on exams and completing project work that is high quality and demonstrates effort
                beyond just completing the basic requirements. Earning an A requires consistently scoring above 90% on
                exams and completing project work of exceptional quality, i.e., going way beyond the basic
                requirements.</p>

                <li>25% of the questions are concept-type questions based on material covered in lecture and lab that is
                  not adequately explained in the textbook. Thus, students should attend lecture and lab, take notes,
                  and review lecture material prior to the exams.</li>
                <li>25% of the questions are based on the reading (textbook and web sources) and the material may NOT be
                  directly presented in lecture. Thus, it is particularly important to do the reading and not rely

              <p>During lab, students will be asked to complete activities and submit a deliverable, which is typically
                one or more documents (HTML, CSS, and images). Students are expected to complete work during lab. This
                allows the instructor to verify that students are completing the lab work and collaborating
                appropriately. Thus, students are not allowed to complete lab work <strong>before</strong> the lab
                period. </p>
              <p> <strong>Lab Deliverable</strong></p>
              <p>It is common for a lab activity to take more than the allotted time (2 hours). Thus, students are
                expected to complete the lab activity on their own and each individual must submit the deliverable
                before the start of the next lab period, otherwise they will receive a zero on the lab deliverable.
                After the lab session, students are not permitted to collaborate or share work done outside of lab.</p>

              <p><strong>Lecture: </strong>Students can be excused (and not penalized) from lecture for illnesses, job
                interviews, and serious commitments such as athletic or academic trips/competitions. However, students
                must inform the instructor as soon as possible, <strong>provide proof/documentation,</strong> and take
                responsibility to acquire notes and information from other students.</p>
              <p><strong>Lab:</strong> Missing lab is more serious than missing lecture because labs involve activities
                that cannot be easily replicated outside of the lab session and these activities are essential to the
                learning goals in the course. Students can be excused (not penalized) from lab and allowed to submit
                late deliverables but the following rules will be strictly enforced:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Job interviews will <strong>NOT</strong> be considered a valid excuse for missing lab. Do not
                  schedule job interviews during your lab time unless you are willing to accept the penalties. </li>
                <li>Practices (athletics), regularly scheduled extra curricular activities, and weekly obligations in
                  other courses will&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;be considered a valid excuses for missing lab.
                  <strong>Students should not register for this class if such activities conflict with the lab
                    session.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Traveling to athletic games that are documented by the Athletic Department are a valid excuse.
                  However, <strong>if you are going to miss more than three labs due to games, it is recommended that
                    you drop the course and take it in the off season.</strong> </li>
                <li>For&nbsp;<strong>illness or medical emergencies</strong>, students should show documentation (a
                  doctor's note, release form, receipt or equivalent) that verifies the excuse. </li>
                <li>For&nbsp;<strong>family emergencies</strong>, funerals, or other serious commitments, students
                  should contact the office of Student Affairs or Academic Affairs. If the emergency is serious, ask an
                  authorized school official to contact all your instructors regarding your absence. If an excuse is not
                  serious enough to contact an authorized school official then the excuse is not serious enough to be
                  accepted by the instructor.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The instructor makes the final decision to excuse or not to excuse an absence. If you are concerned
                that an absence will not be excused, you should contact the instructor as soon as possible. </p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p><strong>Only collaborate during the lab session:</strong> The two-hour lab period is the only time that
                students are allowed to share code and collaborate, but they can only share lab work, not
                project work. The lab session is supervised by the instructor who can provide guidance and feedback on
                what constitutes an appropriate level of help.</p>
              <p><strong>After lab, students are expected to work on their own.</strong> In seeking help outside of lab,
                it is natural to want to share code. However, students should not share code written outside of the lab
                session. Instead, students who wish to help each other should talk about their problems in general or
                abstract ways, which is an important cognitive process in becoming a better, independent coder. This
                instructor considers plagiarism to be instances where a student submits lab deliverables where they
                cannot explain the purpose, function, and details of the submitted code.</p>
              <p><strong>Your goal is to become an independent problem solver:</strong> An important goal in this course
                is for students to learn strategies for becoming more independent with respect to problem solving,
                coding, and debugging. Towards the end of the course, students should not need excessive help from
                classmates, tutors, or even the instructor.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p><strong>Cite your sources:</strong> It is very easy to copy code from other sources and claim it as
                your own. This is academically dishonest and considered plagiarism. However, in web design, it is
                considered professionally acceptable to use <em>open source code</em> (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and
                non-copyrighted design components (layouts, menus, etc.) as long as such usage is documented by
                <strong>giving the original author credit via citation/footnote in the newly published
                  document</strong>. Documenting sources should be done by using HTML citations and by using comments in
                other source files (CSS and JavaScript).
              </p>

              <p><strong>Only use open and public sources:</strong> In this course, integrating code from open sources
                is considered an acceptable practice as long as the integration is non-trivial and leads to a design
                that is significantly different when compared to the original open/public sources. Students will not be
                penalized for using other authors' code as long as the source is cited and as long as the code comes
                from an open source or public domain. In lecture, the instructor will teach students strategies for
                identifying open and public domain sources vs. protected, commercial and copyrighted sources.</p>

              <p><strong>Do not share your code: </strong> While it is natural for students to help each other outside
                of lab, students retain more knowledge if they attempt to write and debug code on their own. It is
                acceptable for students to help each other understand general concepts, but students are prohibited from
                sharing their code or writing code for another student. </p>

              <p><strong>Do not seek excessive help:</strong> It is appropriate to ask for or provide help solving a
                coding problem as long as it is done in a general or abstract way. Appropriate examples include: helping
                a peer understand an error message, sharing debugging strategies, or explaining a concept related to a
                specific problem. But, it is inappropriate to have any other students (including tutors) solve your
                problems directly. Seeking excessive help is a form of cheating. Inappropriate help includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Asking a peer or tutor to write code for you</li>
                <li>looking at another student's working solution</li>
                <li>receiving excessive (step-by-step) help in directly completing a project or lab</li>
              </ul>
              </p>

              <p><strong>If you do not cite code, you better understand it: </strong> Integrating code from multiple
                sources into a new, unique design often requires great effort to get all the parts to work together
                properly. However, it is important that you can point to the parts of your code that you wrote yourself
                and the parts taken from other sources. If a student cannot explain the purpose, function, and details
                of the code that they claim to have written themselves, the code will be considered plagiarized.</p>

              <p><strong>Know the penalties: </strong>Students who present other authors' code, documents, images, or
                designs as their own will receive a grade of zero on the entire project or lab. Students who commit
                plagiarism a second time will again receive a zero, but will also be penalized a full letter-grade in
                the course and a letter describing the student's violation will be sent to Siena's Vice President of
                Academic Affairs </p>

              <p>In this course, I will do my best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives will be
                served equitably. The diversity that students bring to this class will be viewed as a resource, strength
                and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful and inclusive of
                the many identities of students in terms of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic
                status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics. </p>

              <p>For any number of reasons, you may become overwhelmed during your time at Siena. It is very common to

              <p>Fortunately, the Counseling Center, located in Foy Hall Room 110, is a resource to help overcome those
                potential challenges. You can make an appointment by stopping by, calling <strong>518-783-2342</strong>,
                or requesting one online on the Siena Counseling Center <a
