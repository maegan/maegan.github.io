This gives you the best of both worlds:	Visitors can see a preview of the image that is very small in size (53KB) but then 	view the full images that is somewhat large (3.5MB).</p><a href="penguins.jpg"><img src="penguins_thumbnail.jpg" alt="Penguins"></a><h2>Example 2</h2><p>Full-sized image resized using HTML width attribute.  This	is a bad practice because the 3.5MB full-sized images is downloaded	and then resized by the browser.  So, you download the big image, but then don't get to see the full quality.</p><img src="penguins.jpg" width="300" alt="Penguins"><h2>Example 3</h2><p>Full-sized image resized using HTML width and height attribute.  This	is an example of a bad practice because I'm changing the original aspect ratio so the picture looks squeezed.</p><img src="penguins.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Penguins"></body></html>
