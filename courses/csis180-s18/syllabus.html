            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>An average grade is typically B- to B.  To earn a grade of B+ or higher requires consistently scoring above 85% on exams and quizzes and completing project work that is high quality and demonstrates effort beyond just completing the basic requirements. Earning an A requires consistently scoring above 90% on exams and quizzes and completing project work of exceptional quality, i.e., going way beyond the basic requirements.</p>
              <p>On the Midterm and Final exams:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>50% of the questions are  knowledge and fact-type questions based on information  presented in the textbook and reinforced in lecture and lab.</li>
                <li>25% of the questions are concept-type questions based on material covered in lecture and lab that is not adequately explained in the textbook. Thus, students should attend lecture and lab, take notes, and review lecture material prior to the exams.</li>
                <li>25% of the questions  are  based  on the reading (textbook and web sources) and the material may NOT be directly presented in lecture. Thus, it is particularly important to do the reading and not rely entirely on your lecture notes.</li>

              <p>It is common for a lab activity to take more than the allotted time (2 hours).  Thus, students are expected to complete the lab activity on their own and each individual must submit the deliverable before the start of the next lab period, otherwise they will receive a zero on the lab deliverable. After the lab session, students are not permitted to collaborate or share work done outside of lab.</p>

              <p><strong>Lecture: </strong>Students can be excused (and not penalized) from lecture for illnesses, job interviews, and  serious commitments such as athletic or academic trips/competitions. However, students must inform the instructor as soon as possible, <strong>provide proof/documentation,</strong> and take responsibility to acquire notes and information from other students.</p>
              <p><strong>Lab:</strong> Missing lab is more serious than missing lecture because labs involve activities that cannot be easily duplicated outside of the lab session and these activities are essential to the learning goals in the course. Students can be excused (not penalized) from lab and allowed to submit late quizzes and deliverables but the following rules will be strictly enforced:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Job interviews will <strong>NOT</strong> be considered a valid excuse for missing lab. Do not schedule job interviews during your lab time unless you are willing to accept the penalties. </li>
                <li>Practices (athletics), regularly scheduled extra curricular activities, and weekly obligations in other courses will&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;be considered a valid excuses for missing lab. <strong>Students should not register for this class if such activities conflict with the lab session.</strong> </li>
                <li>Traveling to athletic games that are documented by the Athletic Department are a valid excuse. However, <strong>if you are going to miss more than three labs due to games, it is recommended that you drop the course and take it in the off season.</strong> </li>
                <li>For&nbsp;<strong>illness or medical emergencies</strong>, students WILL have to show documentation (a doctor's note,  release form, receipt or equivalent) that verifies the excuse. If an illness is not serious enough to go to a hospital or doctor for treatment then it is not serious enough to be accepted by the instructor.</li>
                <li>For&nbsp;<strong>family emergencies</strong>, funerals, or other serious commitments, students should contact the office of Student Affairs or Academic Affairs. If the emergency is serious, ask an authorized school official to contact all your instructors regarding your absence. If an excuse is not serious enough to contact an authorized school official then the excuse is not serious enough to be accepted by the instructor.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The instructor makes the final decision to excuse or not to excuse an absence. If you are concerned that an absence will not be excused, you should contact the instructor as soon as possible.         </p>

              <p><strong>Only collaborate during the lab session:</strong>The two-hour lab period is the only time that students are allowed to share code and collaborate, but they can only share lab deliverables, not project work. The lab session is supervised by the instructor who can provide guidance and feedback on what constitutes an appropriate level of help.</p>
              <p><strong>After lab, students are expected to work on their own.</strong>In seeking help outside of lab, it is natural to want to share code. However, students should not share code written outside of the lab session.  Instead, students who wish to help each other should talk about  their problems in general or abstract ways, which is an important cognitive process in becoming a better, independent coder.  This instructor considers  plagiarism to be instances where a student submits lab deliverables where they cannot explain the purpose, function, and details of the submitted code.</p>
              <p><strong>Your goal is to become an independent problem solver:</strong> An important goal in this course is for students to learn strategies for becoming more independent with respect to problem solving, coding, and debugging. Towards the end of the course, students should not need excessive help from classmates, tutors, or even the instructor.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p><strong>Cite your sources:</strong> It is very easy to copy code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) from other sources and claim it as your own.  This is academically dishonest and considered plagiarism.  However, in web design, it is considered professionally acceptable to use open source code (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) and non-copyrighted design components (layouts, menus, etc.) as long as such usage is documented by <strong>giving the original author  credit via citation/footnote in the newly published document</strong>. Documenting sources should be done by using HTML citations  and by using comments in other source files (CSS and JavaScript).</p>

              <p><strong>Only use open and public sources:</strong> In this course, integrating code from open  sources   is considered an acceptable practice as long as the integration is non-trivial and leads to a design that is significantly different when compared to the original open/public sources.  Students will not be penalized for using other authors' code as long as the source is cited and as long as the code comes from an open source or public domain. In lecture, the instructor will teach students strategies for identifying open and public domain sources vs. protected, commercial and copyrighted sources.</p>

              <p><strong>Do not share your code: </strong> While it is natural for students to help each other outside of lab, students retain more knowledge if they attempt to write and debug code on their own. It is acceptable for students to help each other understand general concepts, but students are prohibited from sharing their code  or writing code for another student.   </p>

              <p><strong>Do not seek excessive help:</strong> It is appropriate to ask for or provide help solving a coding problem as long as it is done in a general or abstract way. Appropriate examples include: helping a peer understand an error message, sharing debugging strategies, or explaining a  concept related to a specific problem. But, it is inappropriate to have any other students (including tutors) solve your problems directly.  Seeking excessive help is a form of cheating. Inappropriate help includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Asking a peer or tutor to write  code for you</li>
                  <li>looking at another student's working solution</li>
                  <li>receiving excessive (step-by-step) help in directly completing a project or lab</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p><strong>If you do not cite code, you better understand it: </strong> Integrating code from multiple sources into a new, unique design often requires  great effort to get all the parts to work together properly.  However, it is important that you can point to the parts of your code that you wrote yourself and the parts  taken from other sources. If a student cannot explain the purpose, function, and details of the code that they claim to have written themselves, the code will be considered plagiarized.</p>

              <p><strong>Know the penalties: </strong>Students who present other authors' code, documents, images, or designs as their own will receive a grade of zero on the entire project or lab. Students who commit plagiarism a second time will again receive a zero, but will also be penalized a full letter-grade  in the course and a letter describing the student's violation will be sent to Siena's Vice President of Academic Affairs </p>
