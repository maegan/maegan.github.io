              <p>Siena College requires students to wear appropriate face coverings (e.g. masks,
                fully covering both mouth and nose) in all college buildings, including classrooms,
                laboratories and studios.  If students arrive to a class, lab, studio, or office hours
                without a face covering, they will be denied entry, and must leave and obtain a face
                covering before they can return.  Likewise, students are required to wear face coverings
                when in hallways within buildings and to be prepared to put one on if they come
                within six feet of another person when traversing campus.  Students who refuse
                forfeit the right to attend class until a mask is worn and are subject to
                disciplinary action for violating the campus code of conduct (see policy).
                All college employees have the right to refuse services to students if they
                do not comply with these requirements.   </p>

                <p>Students are requested to use available cleaning products to wipe down their
                  desks or work areas when they arrive in class.  Classrooms will be thoroughly
                  cleaned and sanitized at least once daily as well. Students with any symptoms of
                  illness, especially those associated with COVID-19 must not attend class under
                  any circumstances.  As with any absence, they should contact instructors to
                  discuss missed lectures and assignments. </p>

                  <p>If the instructor is quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure, the class will
                    be offered remotely until the Instructor is able to return to campus.
                    Additionally, Instructors may move the class to remote instruction if
                    they feel in-person meetings are not safe.</p>

                covered in class, whether or not you are physically present.  It is <strong>your</strong>
                responsibility to obtain handouts, notes, and materials for any classes you may miss.</p>
              <p>Do not miss an exam; make-up exams will <strong>not</strong> be given unless there is a valid
                advance reason for missing an exam, i.e. scheduled sports event (intramural events do not count),
                class trip, etc.  Arrangements must be made <strong>in advance</strong> by contacting your
                instructor at least two weeks before the scheduled exam date to arrange an alternative time.
                <em>Obviously if you are truly sick or quarantined we will make other arrangements.</em>

                until you know when all your exams are.  We will <strong>not</strong> offer alternative exam
                times for the final exam in this situation.</p>

              <p>In our Franciscan community, diversity is an invitation to celebrate the uniqueness of each individual, as well as the cultural differences that enrich us all. In this course, I will do my best to ensure that students from all backgrounds and perspectives will be served equitably. The diversity that students bring to this class will be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful and inclusive of the many identities of students in terms of gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics.</p>
              <p>Your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity and inclusiveness in this course are encouraged and appreciated.</p>

                you in the event of a College Closure. The Academic Calendar will be adjusted upon reopening; so

              <p>If your situation permits, you should continue with readings and assignments to the best of your ability, per the course schedule.</p>

              <p>Online office hours will be used by me in order to maintain contact with my students.
                You will be able to “check-in” with questions that you have. If you do not have internet
                access available, I will also provide my home phone number and home address, as needed.
                Remember, internet, mail delivery, and telephone services may also be impacted by a Pandemic or other emergency event.</p>

              <p>Finally, stay connected with information regarding the status of the College’s status and Reopening schedule by monitoring the Siena website, <a href="http://www.siena.edu">www.siena.edu.</a></p>
